 * Annotation for a TestType that mimics the Polarion test types

 * and Annotations themselves can neither be extended nor implemented.  If testtype is FUNCTIONAL, then the only
 * allowable subtype1 and 2 is DefTypes.Subtypes.EMPTY.  This will have to be checked for at runtime rather than by
 * the compiler
